      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I’m <strong>Gergely Visnyei</strong> — a DJ and record producer currently based in Amsterdam.  
        My passion for electronic music began at an early age, and it quickly evolved into a lifelong creative journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first breakthrough came when I participated in a local DJ competition in Enschede, which opened the doors to a professional career.  
        Since then, I’ve released several EPs and studio albums that blend melodic house, techno, and organic sounds — always pushing the boundaries of creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m also the co-owner of two Amsterdam-based record labels, <strong>Rejected</strong> and <strong>Green</strong>, where I continue to collaborate with incredible artists and producers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Music for me is not just rhythm and sound — it’s storytelling.  
        Each track I create is a reflection of emotion, energy, and evolution.
